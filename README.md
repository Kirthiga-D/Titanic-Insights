# Titanic-Insights
 A comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring passenger demographics, survival rates, and key factors influencing outcomes.


**##Overview**
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. Aim to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights related to passenger demographics, survival rates, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The **Titanic dataset** is a historical dataset that provides information about passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic during its maiden voyage in 1912. The ship tragically sank after hitting an iceberg, resulting in significant loss of life. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the demographics, social class, and survival rates of passengers.

## Dataset Description
- **Survived**: Binary variable (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger
- **Embarked**: Embarkation port ('S' = Southampton, 'C' = Cherbourg, 'Q' = Queenstown)

## Key Findings
1. **Survival Patterns**:
   - Passengers in higher classes had better survival rates.
   - Females had a higher chance of survival.
   - Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

2. **Socioeconomic Factors**:
   - Fare and passenger class correlated with survival.
   - First-class passengers paid higher fares and had better survival rates.

3. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**:
   - We handled missing data (e.g., age) through imputation.
   - Visualizations helped us explore relationships between variables.

## Conclusion
Analyzing the Titanic dataset provides insights into historical events and human behavior during a crisis. Understanding these patterns can inform emergency response planning and historical studies.
